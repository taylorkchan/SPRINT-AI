        ## Report Unexpected AI Behavior

        Use this template when the AI generates unexpected code, makes incorrect assumptions, or produces low-quality output.

        **This is for:** Incorrect code generation, design misinterpretation, wrong architecture decisions, AI hallucinations
        **NOT for:** App crashes, UI bugs, or installation issues (use Bug Report instead)

        I provided:
        - A Figma design with a login screen containing email/password fields
        - Instructions to use Supabase for authentication
        - Requirement for iOS and Android support

      label: What SPRINT Generated
      description: Describe what the AI produced
      placeholder: |
        SPRINT generated:
        1. Login screen with only email field (missing password)
        2. Used Firebase instead of Supabase
        3. Code only works on iOS, crashes on Android

      placeholder: |
        Expected:
        1. Login screen matching Figma with both email and password fields
        2. Supabase authentication as specified
        3. Working code for both iOS and Android
